# Phase 3 Plan: Components Migration

This document outlines the detailed plan for Phase 3 of the mockup migration, which involves updating components to use the new mockup structure.

## Goals

1. **Update all components** to use new `@/mockups` imports instead of `@/mocks`
2. **Test components** with the new mockup data
3. **Verify visual and functional consistency**
4. **Document any issues** encountered during migration

## Migration Process

### 1. Component Inventory and Analysis

First, we need to create a complete inventory of components using mock data. This was partially done in Phase 1, but we should ensure we have a comprehensive list.

```bash
# Find all imports from @/mocks
grep -r "from '@/mocks" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" ./src
```

Create a detailed inventory spreadsheet with:

- Component path
- Current mock imports
- Corresponding new mockup imports
- Migration status
- Migration issues

### 2. Groupwise Migration Approach

We'll migrate components in groups to minimize disruption:

1. **Dashboard Components**
2. **Event Components**
3. **User Components**
4. **Report Components**
5. **Modal Components**

For each group:

- Create a feature branch for the migration
- Migrate each component individually
- Test the migrated components
- Verify functionality and appearance
- Merge the feature branch when all components in the group are migrated

### 3. Per-Component Migration Process

For each component:

1. **Analyze imports**

   - Identify all imports from `@/mocks`
   - Map to corresponding imports from `@/mockups`

2. **Update imports**

   ```typescript
   // Before
   import { TODAY_EVENTS, EVENT_PARTICIPANTS } from "@/mocks/events";

   // After
   import { TODAY_EVENTS, EVENT_PARTICIPANTS } from "@/mockups";
   ```

3. **Adjust component code as needed**

   - Handle any property name changes
   - Update function calls
   - Adapt to new data structures

4. **Test the component**

   - Render the component in isolation
   - Verify it displays correctly
   - Test interactions
   - Check console for errors

5. **Document any issues**
   - Create an issue report for any problems encountered
   - Note differences in data structure or behavior
   - Document any workarounds implemented

### 4. Testing Strategy

For each migrated component:

1. **Unit testing**

   - Update unit tests to use new mockup imports
   - Verify tests pass with the new data

2. **Visual testing**

   - Compare screenshots before and after migration
   - Verify layouts, formatting, and appearance

3. **Functional testing**

   - Test all interactive features
   - Verify filtering, sorting, and searching
   - Test form submission and validation

4. **Integration testing**
   - Test components together in their parent contexts
   - Verify data flow between components

### 5. Documentation

For each migrated component group:

1. **Update migration tracking**

   - Mark components as migrated in the tracking spreadsheet
   - Note any issues or special considerations

2. **Create migration notes**
   - Document patterns and conventions used
   - Note common issues and solutions
   - Provide guidance for future migrations

## Timeline and Milestones

| Milestone                     | Estimated Completion |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Component inventory complete  | Day 1                |
| Dashboard components migrated | Day 3                |
| Event components migrated     | Day 5                |
| User components migrated      | Day 7                |
| Report components migrated    | Day 9                |
| Modal components migrated     | Day 11               |
| Full testing and verification | Day 13               |
| Documentation complete        | Day 14               |

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data structure differences**

   - Keep a mapping of changed properties
   - Create adapter functions for significant changes

2. **Performance issues**

   - Monitor component render times
   - Optimize data retrieval as needed

3. **Visual regressions**

   - Take screenshots before migration for comparison
   - Use visual diff tools to identify changes

4. **Rollback plan**
   - Keep the original `@/mocks` folder until all testing is complete
   - Maintain feature branches for easy rollback

## Success Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered complete when:

1. All components using mock data have been migrated to use `@/mockups`
2. All components render and function correctly
3. No console errors or warnings related to mockup data
4. All tests pass with the new mockup structure
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
