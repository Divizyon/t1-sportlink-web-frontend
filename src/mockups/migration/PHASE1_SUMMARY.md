# Phase 1 Summary: Analysis and Mapping

## Completed Work

1. **Component Analysis**

   - Identified key components using mock data, primarily in the dashboard section
   - Found imports from @/mocks across components like TodaysEvents, RecentParticipants, and EventParticipationChart
   - Determined that many components are already using @/mockups structure

2. **Mapping Creation**

   - Created MIGRATION_MAP.md with detailed mapping between old and new mock structures
   - Identified patterns for converting existing mocks to schema-based approach
   - Documented component-specific mockup files already implemented

3. **Implementation Planning**

   - Created MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md with concrete steps to complete the migration
   - Outlined the required component-specific mockup files needed
   - Established a migration tracking system

4. **Schema Analysis**
   - Identified existing schemas: eventSchema.ts, userSchema.ts, reportSchema.ts
   - Determined potential schema gaps to be addressed in Phase 2
   - Reviewed current mockup directory structure and export patterns

## Key Insights

1. **Component-Specific Pattern**

   - The new mockup approach uses a more granular, component-specific data pattern
   - Each component only imports the specific data it needs rather than large datasets
   - Schema-based approach provides consistent data structure

2. **Schema Derivation**

   - Component mockups derive from main schemas, ensuring consistency
   - This pattern provides a clear path for backend integration
   - Schema files act as documentation for data requirements

3. **Migration Complexity**
   - Dashboard components are mostly ready for migration
   - Events, users, reports, and modals components need further analysis
   - Some helper functions from old mocks need to be recreated

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Component Analysis**

   - Analyze Events, Users, Reports, and Modals components
   - Document all mock data usage in these components
   - Update migration mapping with the findings

2. **Schema Completion**

   - Review any missing schema types (potentially modalSchema.ts)
   - Ensure schemas provide all necessary data for components
   - Validate schema structures against backend API requirements

3. **Component-Specific Implementation**

   - Create missing component mockup files in priority order
   - Implement data transformation and filtering functions
   - Update main index.ts export file as files are created

4. **Initial Migration Testing**
   - Start with dashboard components already using @mockups
   - Verify data consistency and component functionality
   - Document any issues or unexpected behaviors
