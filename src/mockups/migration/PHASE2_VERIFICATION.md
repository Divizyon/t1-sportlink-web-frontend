## Completed Deliverables

1. **Dashboard Component Mockups**

   - todaysEvents.ts
   - recentParticipants.ts
   - eventParticipationChart.ts
   - analyticsCharts.ts
   - dashboardReports.ts
   - userStats.ts

2. **Event Component Mockups**

   - eventDetails.ts
   - eventList.ts
   - eventForm.ts

3. **User Component Mockups**

   - userProfile.ts
   - userList.ts
   - userActivity.ts

4. **Report Component Mockups**

   - reportDetails.ts
   - reportList.ts

5. **Modal Component Mockups**

   - eventModal.ts
   - userModal.ts
   - reportModal.ts

6. **Documentation**

   - PHASE2_SUMMARY.md
   - MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md (updated)
   - JSDoc comments in all mockup files
   - Usage examples in index.ts

## Implementation Approach

1. **Schema-Based Data**

   All component mockups derive their data from the schema files, ensuring consistency across the application. This approach facilitates future backend integration by maintaining a clear connection between component-specific data and the overall data structure.

2. **Component-Specific Filtering**

   Utility functions were implemented to filter, sort, and transform data based on component-specific requirements. This reduces the amount of data processing needed in the components themselves.

3. **TypeScript Interface Support**

   Strong typing through TypeScript interfaces ensures type safety during development and serves as documentation for component data requirements.

4. **Central Export Management**

   The index.ts file has been carefully updated to export all mockup data in an organized manner, with conflicts resolved through aliasing.

## Status: 100% COMPLETE

All Phase 2 objectives have been met. The migration can now proceed to Phase 3: Components Migration, which includes:

- Updating components to use the new mockup structure
- Testing with the new mockup data
- Validating visual and functional consistency
- Documenting any issues or inconsistencies
