# Phase 3 Verification (In Progress)

This document provides verification details for the components that have been migrated from `@/mocks` to `@/mockups` in Phase 3.

## Completed and Verified Components

### UserDetailModal

- ✅ Successfully migrated from `@/mocks` to `@/mockups`
- ✅ Fixed positioning issues to ensure proper display
- ✅ User profile data now comes from `USER_PROFILES` in `@/mockups/components/users/userProfile`
- ✅ User events data now uses `getUserEvents()` function
- ✅ Added proper type safety for all data conversions
- ✅ Modal appears correctly when triggered by other components
- ✅ Z-index management properly implemented for nested modals

### Dashboard Page

- ✅ Successfully migrated report data from `@/mocks/reports` to `@/mockups/components/reports/reportList`
- ✅ Properly imports `RECENT_REPORTS` and filter functions
- ✅ Report filtering functionality works correctly
- ✅ Dashboard displays correctly with new mock data

### Sidebar Component

- ✅ Successfully migrated from `@/mocks/reports` to `@/mockups/components/reports/reportList`
- ✅ "Raporlar" badge now shows count from `PENDING_REPORTS`
- ✅ Sidebar navigation works as expected

### useDashboardEvents Hook

- ✅ Successfully migrated to use `EVENT_SCHEMA` from `@/mockups/schemas/eventSchema`
- ✅ Properly converts string dates to Date objects
- ✅ Event filtering functions work correctly
- ✅ Dashboard events display correctly

### EventDetailModal

- ✅ Successfully migrated from `@/mocks` to `@/mockups/components/events/eventDetails`
- ✅ Updated to use `SAMPLE_EVENT_DETAILS` instead of `DETAILED_EVENT`
- ✅ Data mapping implemented to match component props
- ✅ Modal functionality preserved with new data structure

### useMessages Hook

- ✅ Created new mockup data at `@/mockups/components/users/userMessages.ts`
- ✅ Completely refactored to use mockups data instead of old mock data
- ✅ Fixed type compatibility issues
- ✅ Added helper functions for conversation management
- ✅ Maintained the same API for calling components

### useReports Hook

- ✅ Migrated to use `@/mockups/components/reports/reportList` and `@/mockups/schemas/reportSchema`
- ✅ Enhanced filtering and sorting capabilities
- ✅ Using pre-calculated statistics from schema
- ✅ Exposed filter options from mockups to components

### useUsers Hook

- ✅ Migrated to use `@/mockups/components/users/userList` and `@/mockups/schemas/userSchema`
- ✅ Enhanced filtering functionality with proper typing
- ✅ Fixed sorting to use mockup utility functions
- ✅ Preserved the original API for components

## Verification Issues and Resolutions

### Export Conflicts in mockups/index.ts

**Issue**: Multiple files were exporting variables with the same names, causing TypeScript to struggle with resolving imports.

**Resolution**:

- Directly importing from component-specific files when needed
- Using explicit named exports with renamed variables to avoid conflicts

### Type Compatibility

**Issue**: Data structures between old and new mockups had differences causing type errors.

**Resolution**:

- Added proper type conversions in the useDashboardEvents hook
- Created type-safe mapping for user events in UserDetailModal
- Used type assertions carefully in useUsers and useReports hooks
- Created adapter functions to transform data as needed

### Modal Positioning

**Issue**: UserDetailModal was appearing outside the visible area when triggered.

**Resolution**:

- Updated modal styling with fixed position and transform-translate
- Added maximum height with overflow scrolling
- Set proper z-index

## Remaining Verification

The following components still need to be migrated and verified:

1. **Modal Components**:

   - ReportsModal (partially migrated but needs verification)
   - NewsModal

2. **Dashboard Components**:
   - EventParticipationChart (already using mockups but needs verification)
   - MonthlyEventsChart (already using mockups but needs verification)

## Verification Approach for Remaining Components

1. **Visual Tests**:

   - Ensure components render the same with new mockup data
   - Verify functionality works as expected

2. **TypeScript Verification**:

   - Ensure no type errors are present
   - Properly handle data conversion between schema and component

3. **Console Error Checks**:
   - Verify no errors appear in the console
   - Test edge cases (empty data, null values, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating and verifying remaining components
2. Update this document as each component is verified
3. Complete final verification once all components are migrated
