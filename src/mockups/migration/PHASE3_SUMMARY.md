# Phase 3 Summary: Components Migration (In Progress)

## Completed Work

### Modal Positioning Improvement

- Fixed positioning issues with the UserDetailModal
- Ensured modals appear correctly when triggered by other components
- Added max height and scrolling behavior for better usability
- Fixed z-index issues for proper stacking of nested modals

### Migration of Components from @/mocks to @/mockups

- Migrated UserDetailModal component to use new mockups structure
- Migrated Sidebar component to use PENDING_REPORTS from new structure
- Updated dashboard page to use report mockups
- Updated useDashboardEvents hook to use EVENT_SCHEMA
- Migrated EventDetailModal to use new mockups structure with SAMPLE_EVENT_DETAILS
- Created new user messages mockup data and updated useMessages hook
- Migrated useReports and useUsers hooks to use new structured mockups
- Created new news modal mockup data and migrated NewsModal component
- Fixed import errors in useMessages.ts hook
- Fixed type issues in ReportsModal component
- Properly implemented type guards for Report types in ReportsModal

### Export Structure Improvements

- Updated the main mockups/index.ts file to avoid naming conflicts
- Resolved import/export issues by using explicit named exports
- Added proper type safety for component data
- Created a systematic organization for message data in userMessages.ts
- Added type exports using the 'export type' syntax for proper TypeScript module resolution
- Created new newsModal.ts mockup file with proper types and example data

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Export Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple files were exporting variables and functions with the same names, causing TypeScript to struggle with export resolution.

**Solution**: We implemented two approaches:

1. Using direct imports from specific component mockup files when needed
2. Explicitly importing and re-exporting with renamed variables to avoid conflicts
3. Using 'export type' for type exports to avoid TypeScript 'isolatedModules' errors

### Type Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Data structures between the old mocks and new mockups had differences that caused type errors.

**Solution**: Added proper type conversions and mapping functions to ensure compatibility:

- Converting string dates to Date objects
- Ensuring correct status values for event types
- Using type assertions when necessary
- Creating interface-aligned objects from schema data
- Implementing proper type guards for union types
- Creating mapping functions between component-specific types and schema types

### Component Rendering Issues

**Problem**: UserDetailModal was appearing outside the visible area when triggered by other components.

**Solution**: Updated the modal styling with:

- Fixed position with transform-translate for centering
- Maximum height with overflow scrolling for better usability
- Proper z-index management for nested modals

### Mock Data Organization

**Problem**: Some components like useMessages required mock data that wasn't available in the new structure.

**Solution**:

- Created new mockup files with proper organization
- Followed schema-first approach for data modeling
- Added utility functions to manipulate the data
- Ensured full compatibility with existing component interfaces

## Remaining Work

The following components still need final verification:

1. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Comprehensive testing of all migrated components
   - Verification of data consistency
   - Visual regression testing

## Implementation Approach Going Forward

1. **Recommended Import Strategy**:

   - For components with potential naming conflicts, import directly from component-specific files
   - For simple imports, use the main mockups index

2. **Type Safety**:

   - Always include proper type conversions when mapping between schema data and component props
   - Use interfaces from @/types when needed
   - Create adapter functions for complex transformations
   - Use 'export type' for type exports in index.ts file
   - Implement type guards for union types

3. **Testing**:
   - Test each component after migration
   - Verify all functionality still works as expected

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive tests of all migrated components
2. Complete the PHASE3_VERIFICATION.md document
3. Begin Phase 4 - Testing and Validation
