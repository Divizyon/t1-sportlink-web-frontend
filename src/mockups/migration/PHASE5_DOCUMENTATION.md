# Phase 5: Cleanup and Finalization

This document outlines the cleanup process for the mockup migration and provides guidance for developers on how to use the new mockups structure.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Deprecation Warnings

All files in the `@/mocks` directory have been updated with deprecation warnings:

- Added a central `deprecation-warning.ts` file that displays console warnings when any mock file is imported
- Updated JSDocs in each file with `@deprecated` tags and migration guidance
- Updated the main `index.ts` file to import the deprecation warning

Example of console warning that will appear when old mocks are imported:

```
[DEPRECATED] @/mocks directory is deprecated. Please use @/mockups instead.
```

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` to mark Phase 5 as completed
- Created this documentation file to serve as a reference for the completed migration
- Provided clear migration path for any remaining code still using the old mocks

## Migration Status

All planned tasks have been completed:

| Phase | Description            | Status      | Notes                                           |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Analysis and Mapping   | ✅ COMPLETE | All components analyzed and mapped              |
| 2     | Implementation         | ✅ COMPLETE | All schemas and component mockups created       |
| 3     | Components Migration   | ✅ COMPLETE | All components updated to use the new structure |
| 4     | Testing and Validation | ✅ COMPLETE | All components tested and issues addressed      |
| 5     | Cleanup                | ✅ COMPLETE | Deprecation warnings added and docs updated     |

## Developer Guide: Using the New Mockups

### Structure Overview

The new mockups structure follows a schema-based approach:

```
src/mockups/
├── schemas/              # Core data schema definitions
│   ├── eventSchema.ts    # Event data structure
│   ├── userSchema.ts     # User data structure
│   ├── reportSchema.ts   # Report data structure
│   └── index.ts          # Schema exports
├── components/           # Component-specific mockup data
│   ├── dashboard/        # Dashboard component mockups
│   ├── events/           # Event component mockups
│   ├── users/            # User component mockups
│   ├── reports/          # Report component mockups
│   └── modals/           # Modal component mockups
└── index.ts              # Central export point
```

### Import Recommendations

1. **For general access to schema data:**

```typescript
import { USER_SCHEMA, EVENT_SCHEMA, REPORT_SCHEMA } from "@/mockups";
```

2. **For component-specific data:**

```typescript
import { TODAY_EVENTS } from "@/mockups";
// or directly from component file:
import { TODAY_EVENTS } from "@/mockups/components/dashboard/todaysEvents";
```

3. **For TypeScript types:**

```typescript
import { User, Event, Report } from "@/types/dashboard";
// Do not use mock types, use the actual application types
```

### Best Practices

1. **Component-specific imports:** Only import the specific data your component needs

2. **Avoid modification:** Don't modify the mockup data directly, create local copies if needed

3. **Type consistency:** Ensure your component props match the mockup data types

4. **Documentation reference:** Refer to the schema files for documentation on data structure

### Converting from Old Mocks

| Old Import                                                       | New Import                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `import { USERS } from '@/mocks/users';`                         | `import { USER_SCHEMA } from '@/mockups';`       |
| `import { ALL_EVENTS } from '@/mocks/events';`                   | `import { EVENT_SCHEMA } from '@/mockups';`      |
| `import { TODAY_EVENTS } from '@/mocks/events';`                 | `import { TODAY_EVENTS } from '@/mockups';`      |
| `import { REPORTS } from '@/mocks/reports';`                     | `import { REPORT_SCHEMA } from '@/mockups';`     |
| `import { DASHBOARD_REPORTS } from '@/mocks/dashboard-reports';` | `import { DASHBOARD_REPORTS } from '@/mockups';` |

## Future Considerations

1. **Removal Timeline:** The old `@/mocks` directory will be fully removed in the next major version update

2. **API Alignment:** The new mockup structure is designed to align with the expected backend API responses

3. **Testing Strategy:** Components using mockups should be tested with both mockup data and API data to ensure compatibility

## Conclusion

The migration from `@/mocks` to `@/mockups` is now complete. The new structure provides better organization, stronger typing, and clearer alignment with backend APIs. All components have been updated to use the new structure, and deprecation warnings are in place to guide any remaining code that might still use the old mocks.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the new mockups, please refer to this documentation or contact the development team.
